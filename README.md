# Assigment 1 for course COSC2659 - IOS Development: Book WishList App

## Introduction
This is the first assigment project for course COSC2659 - IOS Application Development by Mr. Tom Huynh. The requirement was to build a mini IOS app to apply fundamental SwiftUI concepts and view navigation. Since reading books is one of my favourite hobbies for leisure, I decided to build an app that could help me save a list of books that I want to read someday in the future. The app idea is taken inspiration from the wish list function in ecommerce websites.

I sincerely thank Mr. Tom Huynh, Lecturer of the course for making my SwiftUI learning experience more joyful and interesting ❤.

## App Overview & Features
This is an IOS app built with an intention to help users save a wish list of books that they might want to read in the future. In particular, the app keeps track of the book data and displays them in an intuitive user interface in which users can easily navigate through the list anytime they want. Regarding the book data, users can  store some essential information about the book that they might want to recap such as book title, author, category, and description. This helps them quickly grasp an overview of the book so that they can decide whether to read or buy it whenever they retrieve the saved records. In addition, the app supports search functionality and an “Add to Wishlist” button that allows users to add new records.
